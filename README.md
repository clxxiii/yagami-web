# Yagami Web

This repo contains all of the code for the web interface of the yagami app

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

If you install the [Vite](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=antfu.vite) extension for VSCode, the devserver step will be handled for you.

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
